ABSTRACTION
------------
Hide Complexity and show Functionality.


Can be done through below 2-ways----->
--------------------------------
1.Abstract Class
2.Interface


Difference b/w Abstract Class and Normal Class
------------------------------------------------
1.There is no object creation of Abstract class but in Normal classes.
2.Only reference can be created of abstract classes.
3.We can not define Abstract method in normal class but in Abstract class.

Since there is no implementation of abstract methods in abstract class. 
Thus, if will create an object of abstract class, we won't be able to call them(abstract methods).


Note:
-----
Abstract keyword is used to create abstract class/methods.
Only abstract class can have abstract method;
Any class extending the abstract class, will must have to override and implement the all abstract method, else you will get an error.




Interface----
-----------
Introduced in JDK-8.
It is most important concept in JAVA above all.
Removing this concept from JAVA means removing JVM form JAVA and removing JVM means removing heart of JAVA and without heart anything is nothing.











Note:
-----
JDK-5: Collection-Framework was introduced.


JDK-8(in 2014): 
---------------
1.Sold to Oracle from SunMicro-Systems.
2.Interface was introduced.
