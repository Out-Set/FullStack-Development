Important:
----------

1. Multiple-Classes     &     Multiple-Thread     ----->     use Thread Class

2. Single-Class    &     Multiple-Thread     ----->     use Runnable Interface



Main method(): Also runs with the help of thread.

getName(): returns the name of the thread.
setname(): set the name of the thread.


Important-Proble-To-Notice
--------------------------
In all the Thread implementation(through Thread class or Runnalbe interface), we are creating the method run() but to start the thread we are using start() method inside main. why?

sol=>
------
goto the program ImpProg.java
In Thread class, There is a start() method and inside start() method there is a run() method.
So, by default we have to implement run() method only.
